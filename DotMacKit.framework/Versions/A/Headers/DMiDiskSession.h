 * @method copyPath:toPath:handler:
 * @abstract Copies the resource at the source path to the destination path.
 * @discussion This method will create a copy of the source resource at the given destination 
 *	path, but will not overwrite an existing resource.  Each path argument can be either a 
 *	local or a remote path--passing a local source path and remote destination path leads to 
 *	an upload of a local resource, while passing a remote source path and local destination 
 *	path leads to a download of a remote resource. If two remote paths are provided as
 *	arguments, this method issues a single, server-side COPY request.  This method has 
 *	usage similar to that of the corresponding method of NSFileManager.  However, it does 
 *	not support the usage of a callback handler and if a non-nil handler argument is 
 *	passed to this method, it will be ignored. Only the data forks of files and 
 *	directories are copied.  In the case of an upload, local symlinks are not preserved--
 *	when a symlink is encountered, the resource it references will be uploaded.  
 *	[Note: If two local paths are provided as arguments, this method calls 
 *	NSFileManager's copyPath:toPath:handler: method with whatever handler argument was 
 *	provided.]
 * @param source A local or remote source path.
 * @param destination A local or remote destination path.
 * @param handler The handler argument is ignored.
