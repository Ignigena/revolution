 *	transactions done asynchronously.  After obtaining an asynchronously-fired DMTransaction 
 *	object, the caller need not worry about the transaction completing and generating a 
 *	delegate callback before the context can be set--since callbacks are made on the same 
 *	client thread which launched the transaction, setting the context simply needs to be 
 *	done immediately after generating the transaction and in the same thread.  That way, 
 *	even if the transaction completes immediately, the context will still be set before the 
 *	completion callback is made.

 *	However, if no error occurred or the response has not yet completed when this 
 *	method is called, kDMUndefined will be returned.  [Note: If the http status 
 *	code that was received is considered a failure code for the given transaction
